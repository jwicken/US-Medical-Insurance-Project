'US-Medical-Insurance-Project'

This project was completed early on in my Data Analytics journey. 


For this project I followed along with another Kaggle users code to learn more about python libraries & machine learning. I also used AI assistance to learn about various functions and Python syntax. Overall this was an interesting project, since I was able to uncover (what appeared to be) a few errors in the prevous analysis.
